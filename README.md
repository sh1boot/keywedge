My old 8051-based keyboard wedge.

And apparently the one I prototyped on my C64 as well!

It sat on the PS/2 bus between the keyboard and PC, and connected to old
microswitch joysticks.  Joystick actions were translated to keystrokes so old
DOS games could be played retro style (yes, there was a retro even back when
DOS was a thing).  Though I doubt I was using DOS at all by the time I was done
tinkering with it.

The C64 version plugged into the user port and was just an edge connector with
a chip and some wires soldered to it... and a piece of string so I could pull
it out without bending anything.
